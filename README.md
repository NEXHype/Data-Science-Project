# Title: Impact of Physical Attributes on 3-Point Shooting in the NBA's Latest Season


# Overview

This project explores the impact of physical attributes on 3-point shooting performance in the NBA's latest season. We collected and analyzed data on NBA players, including their 3-point shooting percentages, physical attributes (height and weight), and positions.

# Data Sources

We obtained our data from the NBA's official statistics API. The dataset includes information on player statistics, such as 3-point attempts and 3-point field goals, as well as player details, including height, weight, and position.

# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

We performed thorough data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values and creating additional features, such as the interaction of height and weight.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Our EDA focused on understanding the distributions of 3-point shooting percentages, physical attributes, and positions. We created visualizations to explore relationships and trends in the data.

# Statistical Model

We built a multivariate linear regression model to examine the impact of physical attributes and positions on 3-point shooting performance. The model's results provided insights into which factors were statistically significant.

# Tableau Dashboard

To make our findings more accessible, we created a Tableau dashboard that visualizes the relationships between 3-point shooting percentages, physical attributes, and positions.

# Key Findings

1. The R-squared value of our model suggests a poor linear relationship between variables, but some factors remain statistically significant.
2. Position 5 (centre) had the most significant impact on 3-point shooting percentages.

# Challenges
We encountered challenges in data collection, feature engineering, and model interpretation. These challenges are common in data science projects and provided opportunities for learning and improvement.

# Future Work

Future work could include collecting data from multiple NBA seasons to identify long-term trends and using more advanced modeling techniques to improve predictive accuracy.
